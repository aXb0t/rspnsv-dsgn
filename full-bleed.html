    <p>Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! Cause he roped me into this! I wish that shotgun was my penis. Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! If you break the rules, try to leave or lose the game, you will die. Just like Saaaaw. Where are my testicles, Summer? Sorry I didn't listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. Guess I gotta learn how to live in the moment a little more. Don't be trippin dog we got you.</p>
